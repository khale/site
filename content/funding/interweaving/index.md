NSF Award [CNS-1763612](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1763612&HistoricalAwards=false);
 $305,578 (Collaborative total: $1.2M); September 2018 through August 2021. This project is a collaborative effort with
[Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org), [Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/), and [Nikos Hardavellas](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hardav/)
at [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu).

This project seeks to advance the state of the art of parallel systems.
Usually, the layers of a parallel system - the compiler, run-time system,
operating system, and hardware - are considered as separate entities with
a rigid division of labor. This project investigates an alternative model,
"interweaving," in which these layers are integrated as needed to improve the
performance, scalability, and efficiency of the specific parallel system.

The research involves five thrusts: (1) Blending studies using compiler
technology to achieve integration of code that would normally be found in
distinct, separately compiled layers. (2) Coherence considers hardware without
memory coherence and its implications throughout the "interwoven" parallel
system. (3) Predictability studies the integration of hard real-time behavior
into a parallel system through hardware and compiler support. (4) Mapping
considers address translation for parallel systems given hardware and compiler
support. (5) Debugging studies how to debug an interwoven system. These
investigations go hand-in-hand with the continual development of a prototype
and its evaluation.

Parallel systems are of critical importance for science and engineering, and
have become ubiquitous; even simple devices like smartphones incorporate
growing parallelism. The project thus has the potential to improve a wide range
of applications both through its ideas and is open code. It will also train
Ph.D. and undergraduate students, and enhance collaborations between two
Chicago-area universities.

Code, data, and results will be maintained publicly at [this website](http://interweaving.org)
for the project's duration, and requests considered for five years afterwards.
