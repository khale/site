CNS Award [CNS-1718252](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1718252&HistoricalAwards=false);
$249,771 (Collaborative total: $499,735); August 2017 through July 2020. This project is a collaborative effort with
[Jack Lange](http://www.prognosticlab.org/~jarusl/) at the [University of
Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu). 

Current cloud systems leverage either heavy-weight virtualization (running
applications inside full-fledged virtual machines (VMs) with their own
operating systems) or containers (light-weight software environments that share
a single underlying operating system). This collaborative project aims to
increase the efficiency of cloud systems by enabling the rapid deployment of
specialized operating system and runtime (SOS/R) environments optimized for
particular applications or runtime systems. This will allow users of
applications with special performance requirements to enjoy the convenience of
cloud infrastructure without sacrificing performance or design constraints
imposed by general-purpose operating systems.

The project will advance the state of the art in cloud system software by: (a)
enabling the development of a general specialized hosting framework allowing
the deployment of arbitrary system software stacks as both VMs and native
co-kernel instances; (b) a set of interfaces and mechanisms to allow SOS/R
environments to react to highly dynamic and variable hardware resource
availability; (c) novel approaches that leverage hardware virtualization
features to host SOS/Rs; and (d) a thorough evaluation of all of these
approaches using realistic cloud workloads at scale.

This work will enable users of cloud systems to efficiently deploy diverse and
specialized system architectures. This will not only enhance the capabilities
of existing cloud and data center platforms, but will also enable the
deployment of new types of operating systems and runtimes. Prototype systems
produced in this effort will be made available to the general public as
open-source software, and will also be leveraged as teaching and platforms for
courses in operating systems, virtualization, runtime environments, and general
cloud computing.

Data, code, and results generated from the project will be made freely
available indefinitely on the team's webpages. All software packages will be
accompanied by instructions for building and running them using freely
available open-source tools. Data and results will be made available in
compressed archive formats. Links to specific repositories (such as git
repositories for code) will be made public either at http://hexsa.halek.co or
http://prognosticlab.org.
