NSF Award [CNS-1730689](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1730689&HistoricalAwards=false); 
$1,000,000; July 2017 through June 2020. This project is a collaborative effort with
[Ioan Raicu](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~iraicu/) and [Xian-He Sun](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~scs/sun/) at
IIT.

This project will build a testbed for experimenting with reconfigurable
communication and Input/Output subsystems to conduct low-level systems
research. This goal of this research is to remove network, memory and storage
performance bottlenecks by dynamically reconfiguring them to the needs of an
application. As the nature of computing applications change from
compute-centric to data-centric, communication of data comprises a large part
of program execution. In this testbed, the organization of memory, storage and
their connectivity will change dynamically to adapt to the workload to improve
overall performance of the executing programs.

The PIs will build a dynamically configurable cluster called MYSTIC to study
system re-configurability across the entire computing stack, from the processor
to memory, storage, and the network. It will allow low-level experimentation
and reconfiguration at the level of networks-on-chip (NoC), universal memory,
and the network interconnect with multidimensional network topologies.
Dynamically reconfiguring interconnects, memory and storage will speed-up
applications running on a heterogeneous computing environment. Examples of
target applications include dynamic multipath routing for load-balancing,
universal memory that deploys byte addressable Non-Volatile Dual In-line Memory
Module (NVDIMM) for persistent storage and Network-on-Chip (NoC) abstractions
for Operating Systems.
