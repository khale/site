NSF Award [CCF-1757964](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1757964&HistoricalAwards=false); 
$333,106; February 2018 through January 2021. This project is in collaboration with [Ioan Raicu](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~iraicu/) at IIT
as well as [Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com) and [Aaron Elmore](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aelmore/) at the University of Chicago.

This project extends the BigDataX program, a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and the
University of Chicago (UChicago). The BigDataX site focuses on undergraduate
research in both the theory and practice of big data computing at extreme
scales. BigDataX includes a diverse group of 10 undergraduate students, who
will conduct research over a 10 week period, in the area of big data and how it
will impact the design, analysis, and implementation of run-time systems and
storage systems to support big data applications. This research will make
extreme scale computing more tractable, touching every branch of computing in
high-end computing and datacenters. These advancements will impact scientific
discovery and economic development at the national level, and they will
strengthen a wide range of research activities enabling efficient access,
processing, storage, and sharing of valuable scientific data from many
disciplines. The proposed work will place students in the middle of
a technological revolution which will revolutionize the computing domain.

The primary objective of this proposal is to promote a data-centric view of
scientific and technical computing, at the intersection of distributed systems
theory and practice. This proposal includes 6 mentors, with a variety of
complementing expertise from theory to systems, distributed systems, storage
management, and data science. The mentors have extensive experience in
mentoring undergraduate students, collectively having worked with over one
hundred students in research activities, publishing dozens peer-reviewed
workshop/conference/journal papers at top venues together with undergraduate
students. The students that will be part of the BigDataX program will be
exposed to big data applications, large data sets, and various distributed
systems such as the Mystic reconfigurable testbed at IIT, Chameleon cloud and
Theta supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, the XSEDE national
cyberinfrastructure, and the Amazon Web Services cloud.
