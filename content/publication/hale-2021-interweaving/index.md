abstract: The layered structure of the system software stacks we use today allows
  for separation of concerns and increases portability. However, the confluence of
  widely available virtualization and hardware partitioning technology, new OS techniques,
  rapidly changing hardware, and significant advances in compiler technology together
  present a ripe opportunity for restructuring the stack, particularly to support
  effective parallel execution. We argue that there are cases where layers, particularly
  the compiler, run-time, kernel, and hardware, should be interwoven, enabling new
  optimizations and abstractions. We present four examples where we have successfully
  applied this interweaving model of system design, and we outline several lines of
  promising ongoing work.
