abstract: As computational infrastructure extends to the edge, it will increasingly
  offer the same fine-grained resource provisioning mechanisms used in large-scale
  cloud datacenters, and advances in low-latency, wireless networking technology will
  allow service providers to blur the distinction between local and remote resources
  for commodity computing. From the users' perspectives, their devices will no longer
  have fixed computational power, but rather will appear to have flexible computational
  capabilities that vary subject to the shared, disaggregated edge resources available
  in their physical proximity. System software will transparently leverage these ephemeral
  resources to provide a better end-user experience. We discuss key systems challenges
  to enabling such tightly-coupled, disaggregated, and ephemeral infrastructure provisioning,
  advocate for more research in the area, and outline possible paths forward.
