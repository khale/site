abstract: Specialized operating systems have enjoyed a recent revival driven both
  by a pressing need to rethink the system software stack in several domains and by
  the convenience and flexibility that on-demand infrastructure and virtual execution
  environments offer. Several barriers exist which curtail the widespread adoption
  of such highly specialized systems, but perhaps the most consequential of them is
  that these systems are simply difficult to use. In this paper we discuss the challenges
  faced by specialized OSes, both for HPC and more broadly, and argue that what is
  needed to make them practically useful is a reasonable development and deployment
  model that will form the foundation for a kernel ecosystem that allows intrepid
  developers to discover, experiment with, contribute to, and write programs for available
  kernel frameworks while safely ignoring complexities such as provisioning, deployment,
  cross-compilation, and interface compatibility. We argue that such an ecosystem
  would allow more developers of highly tuned applications to reap the performance
  benefits of specialized kernels.
