 abstract = {Far memory tiers improve memory utilization by enabling memory intensive applications to use idle memory from other machines over the network. Recently, compiler approaches to far memory have demonstrated how static analysis can be leveraged to automatically transform applications to make efficient use of remote memory tiers. However, policies in these compilers, e.g., the determination of whether objects should be remoted, prefetched, or evacuated are made conservatively at compile time or require profiling. While profiling can alleviate conservative policies, profile-guided systems can be expensive and may not work well for applications that have variation in their inputs. We propose CaRDS, system that combines both runtime and static analysis to determine far memory policies dynamically, at data structure granularity, and without profiling. CaRDS remoting policies can outperform prior automatic approaches by up to ∼ 2× and are within 25% of profile-guided systems when the local memory is highly constrained.},
