Thanks to tons of hard work from HExSA Lab members, I am incredibly honored to
have been awarded the NSF CAREER grant! Many thanks to NSF, to all my
collaborators, mentors, colleagues, and most of all to my wonderful students!
I am thrilled to be able to continue our exciting research on novel
virtualization technology and system software for secure and efficient cloud
computing.
