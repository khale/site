I am currently looking for talented, hard-working PhD students broadly in the
systems area. Our group focuses on next generation experimental computer systems,
with a particular emphasis on operating systems, high-performance computing,
and computer architecture. We also do work in virtualization and cloud
computing, security, high-performance networking, parallel programming
languages, and runtime systems. If you are curious about what goes on inside
all of the computational devices that increasingly pervade our lives, if you
enjoy building things and hacking on cutting-edge systems, and if you like to
think about the future of computers, science, and technology, I encourage you
to apply. I am especially interested in recruiting deeply curious students who
enjoy prototyping new ideas and who have a passion for diving into,
understanding, and creating new systems.


## Requirements and Qualifications
Qualified applicants will have a solid CS background under their belts, with
a strong set of programming skills and particular strength in systems. I expect
you will have at least a basic understanding of algorithms, data structures,
computer organization and architecture, operating systems, and compilers.
Particularly well-suited candidates will have experience with parallel
programming and will have had experience working in substantial code bases, such
as OSes, compilers, VMMs, emulators, or the like.

## Why come to Oregon State and Corvallis?
Our group is part of the broader [HPC group](https://hipcastor-osu.github.io/hipcastor-site/)
at OSU, and in addition to core systems work, we also work with domain scientists in
high-impact areas to accelerate core science workloads. 

We are continuing to hire exceptional faculty in the systems area at OSU, and our grad
program is now among the top 50 in the US, and continuing to rise. EECS at OSU is a large
department, so whether you want to collaborate with roboticists, AI faculty, or electrical
engineers, there are countless opportunities. 

Corvallis is a great place to pursue graduate studies. You can enjoy a beautiful college town within
a breathtaking natural environment while pursuing cutting edge research. Portland is not far, 
so you can also get the benefits of a large US metro.
