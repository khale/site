I am currently looking for talented, hard-working PhD students broadly in the
systems area. Our lab focuses on next generation experimental computer systems,
with a particular emphasis on operating systems, high-performance computing,
and computer architecture. We also do work in virtualization and cloud
computing, security, high-performance networking, parallel programming
languages, and runtime systems. If you are curious about what goes on inside
all of the computational devices that increasingly pervade our lives, if you
enjoy building things and hacking on cutting-edge systems, and if you like to
think about the future of computers, science, and technology, I encourage you
to apply. I am especially interested in recruiting deeply curious students who
enjoy prototyping new ideas and who have a passion for diving into,
understanding, and creating new systems.


## Requirements and Qualifications
Qualified applicants will have a solid CS background under their belts, with
a strong set of programming skills and particular strength in systems. I expect
you will have at least a basic understanding of algorithms, data structures,
computer organization and architecture, operating systems, and compilers.
Particularly well-suited candidates will have experience with parallel
programming and will have had experience working in substantial code bases, such
as OSes, compilers, VMMs, emulators, or the like.

## Why come to Illinois Tech and Chicago?
[Illinois Tech (IIT)](https://iit.edu) is a rising star in the Chicago area, and both the
university as a whole and the [CS department](https://iit.edu/computer-science) are undergoing a period of
significant growth, with talented new faculty coming aboard every year.
Illinois Tech's CS department has particular strength in the HPC and
distributed systems area.

If you're looking for a top-notch graduate school experience, but prefer to
live in a metropolitan area, Chicago is a fantastic choice. The tech scene is
on the rise, with the City of Chicago showing significant interest in
transforming the city into a tech hub. The big schools in the area form
a tight-knit community of scholarship, so doing research in Chicago will
present many opportunities for collaboration across institutions in the
Midwestern US. Aside from the academic motivations for coming to Chicago, it
would be difficult to find a more exciting city to live in while carrying out
graduate studies. If you're interested in food culture, art, the theater,
microbreweries and craft cocktails, great local coffee, a thriving live music
and festival scene, a large swath of parks for cycling and running,
comparatively cheap housing, great public transit, or sports, then you will
enjoy living in Chicago. There really is something for everyone here.
