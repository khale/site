I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/).
I was previously at Illinois Tech. I lead the [laboratory for high-performance,
experimental systems and architecture (HExSA)](/lab) where we focus on various aspects
of computer systems research.  My research interests
span several areas in systems including OS, computer architecture, embedded
systems, system security, and virtualization. A current primary focus of our
lab is the design of specialized system software stacks for parallel and
emerging computing applications. You can see my publications [below](#pubs).

I have been fortunate to receive the NSF CAREER award (2023-2028), as well as the IIT College of Computing's Excellence in Teaching and Excellence in Research awards. 

I received my PhD from [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu), where I worked with [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org).  Before that
I received my B.S. in computer science from UT Austin, where I worked with [Boris Grot](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bgrot/)
and
