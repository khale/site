I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer
Science](http://iit.edu/computer-science) at the [Illinois Institute of
Technology](https://www.iit.edu). I lead the [laboratory for high-performance,
experimental systems and architecture (HExSA)](/lab) where we focus on various aspects
of computer systems research.  My research interests
span several areas in systems including OS, computer architecture, embedded
systems, system security, and virtualization. A current primary focus of our
lab is the design of specialized system software stacks for parallel and
emerging computing applications. You can see my publications [below](#pubs).


I received my PhD from [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu) in
2016 under the guidance of [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org).  Before that
I received my B.S. in computer science from UT Austin, where I worked with [Boris Grot](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bgrot/)
and 
[Steve Keckler](https://research.nvidia.com/person/stephen-keckler).

**I am actively looking for new PhD students! Students interested in working with me
should see [this page]({{< ref "/recruiting" >}})**.

If you're an undergrad considering research or going to grad school, you should take
a look at [this page]({{< ref "/ugrad-research" >}}).
