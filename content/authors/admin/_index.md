I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/).
I was previously at Illinois Tech. My research interests
span several areas in systems including OS, computer architecture, embedded
systems, system security, and virtualization. A current focus 
is the design of specialized system software stacks for parallel and
emerging computing applications. I am a member of the [HiPCastor group](https://hipcastor-osu.github.io/hipcastor-site/) at OSU. You can see my publications [below](#pubs).

I have been fortunate to receive the NSF CAREER award (2023-2028), as well as the IIT College of Computing's Excellence in Teaching and Excellence in Research awards. 

**I am currently recruiting highly motivated PhD students to join our [HPC group](https://hipcastor-osu.github.io/hipcastor-site/) at Oregon State. Please see [here]({{< ref "/recruiting" >}}) for more info.**

If you're an undergrad/MS student considering research or going to grad school, you should take
a look at [this page]({{< ref "/ugrad-research" >}}).
