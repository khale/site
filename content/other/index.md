## Other Stuff

I love music. I'm a tenor sax player but also dabble with the
guitar and piano (Sonny Rollins is my favorite sax player, Oscar Peterson - piano, Kenny Burrel - guitar).  Lately I've been listening to 
a lot of [Sam Evian](https://www.samevian.com/). 
My favorite live
venues in Chicago are [The Empty Bottle](https://www.emptybottle.com/) and Thalia Hall. 

I'm excited by all of the sciences, and I always enjoy getting to talk to
domain scientists about their work at places like [SC](https://supercomputing.org). I especially am interested in 
Astronomy, but unfortunately Chicago isn't the best place for stargazing. When I can, I like to get out with my
Celestron StarSense Newtonian. 

I'm an avid reader of all genres, but especially historical fiction, 
hard sci-fi, and non-fiction. 

I love to travel. My next target is either Istanbul or Scandinavia. I speak
Japanese (I lived in Tokyo a while) and I'd like to learn a European language.

Some places I've lived: Corpus Christi, TX; Austin, TX; San Antonio, TX;
Evanston, IL; Tokyo; Albuquerque, NM; Mountain View, CA.
